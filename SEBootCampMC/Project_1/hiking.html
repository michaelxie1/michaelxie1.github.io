    <p>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded
      by some of Iceland’s most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms
      in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location. This popular day tour
      is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!</p>
