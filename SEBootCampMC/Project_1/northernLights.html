          begin high in the Earth’s atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more
          than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped
          in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing
          light show.</p>

         <br>
        <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica.
          Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you’d like to take in
          these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene,
          consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light
          pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night.
          Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time.
          Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field
          lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating
          aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinoxin September, when there
          are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours
          of your location here, or by using a sky guide app. </p>
